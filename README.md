This repository contains the code for a Streamlit-based portfolio application, which has been dockerized and is deployed on Render using GitHub Actions. The project showcases how to build, containerize, and deploy a Streamlit application seamlessly using Docker and automated CI/CD pipelines.



## Running the Application Locally

To run the Streamlit application locally, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will start the Streamlit server and open your application in a web browser.

## Building and Running with Docker

### 1. Log in to Docker Hub

Before building the Docker image, you need to log in to Docker Hub. Replace `<username>` with your Docker Hub username:

```bash
docker login -u <username>
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the root of the repository. Replace `<username>` with your Docker Hub username:

```bash
docker build -t <username>/streamlit-portfolio:v1 .
```

This command will create a Docker image tagged with `v1`.

### 3. Verify Docker Images

List all Docker images on your local machine to ensure that the build was successful:

```bash
docker images
```

### 4. Run the Docker Container

Run the Docker container using the image you built. This command will map port `8051` on your local machine to port `8051` in the container. Replace `<username>` with your Docker Hub username:

```bash
docker run -d --name portfolio -p 8051:8051 <username>/streamlit-portfolio:v1
```

The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8051`.

### 5. Push the Docker Image to Docker Hub

Finally, push the Docker image to Docker Hub to make it available for deployment. Replace `<username>` with your Docker Hub username:

```bash
docker push <username>/streamlit-portfolio:v1
```


## Deployment

The Docker image can be deployed to various platforms, such as Render, AWS, or any other cloud provider that supports Docker containers.
